    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>
        During my academic studies at UW Madison, I worked with the <a href="https://centerhealthyminds.org/">Center for Healthy Minds (CFHM)</a> to develop interactive software to visualize experimental neuroscience data. My work centered around a collaboration with CFHM Researcher Dave Perlman to develop better tools for understanding time dimensional data generated by fMRI experiments he had been working on at the Center.<br><br>
        Dave’s research involved, in his own words, “studying the time course of the brain’s response to pain as an indicator of ruminative or elaborative mental processes that alter the overall aversive tone of the stimulus by extending the duration of affective response.” His research was part of a larger effort by the CFMH to understand how mindfulness practices relate to human experience of affective responses, such as pain and other stimuli. <br><br>
        This meant that having insightful tools for visually analyzing time series experimental datasets was of utmost importance to one of the primary research objectives of the CFMH, and for Dave’s work in particular. At the time, neuroscience visualization packages provided extremely crude 3D rendering and almost no useful animation for activation maps, which were an important data source in Dave’s experiments. Furthermore, these existing tools were never web-based, making collaborative analysis and sharing of results very tedious.<br><br>
        Over the course of my work with CFMH, I familiarized myself with the data space of fMRI research and created an interactive JavaScript application which helped Dave present previously inaccessible insights from his experiments.<br><br>

    <h4>User Research</h4>
    <p>
        My initial efforts were to understand the existing workflow of acquiring data from the MRI machine, rendering it into a format suitable for interaction, then presenting the salient characteristics to other researchers. This entire workflow was primarily done in a tool called Freesurfer, which is useful for manipulating and refining data coming from the MRI but cumbersome to use as an interactive visualization medium. Because of the lack of standard tools for visualizing this data more effectively, David and other researchers struggled to shoehorn their use cases into Freesurfer’s native 3D viewer

    <h4>Delivering the Product</h4>
    <p>
        The ideal solution for David and his colleagues was a web based tool that would support easily importing, superimposing, and interacting with a variety of data types yielded by the Freesurfer post-process pipeline. This data included time dimensional image volume stacks captured by the MRI machine, 3d meshes approximating the cortical surface, and point cloud data detailing the activations across this surface in response to experimental stimuli.<br><br>
        I looked to use Three.js in my initial prototypes of this tool as it provides a simple API for bootstrapping an interactive 3d visualization. While Three would have allowed for an extreme level of granular customization, creating parsers for the MRI specific data formats and manually reading the affine transform metadata in javascript in order to import and correctly align all the data was a task with high development overhead. I instead pivoted to using XTK.js, which had already created libraries for these parsers. This allowed me to deliver an effective product on a much quicker timescale with a substantially smaller codebase.<br><br>

    <h3>Impact:</h3>
    <p>
        David and his colleagues at the CFHM were able to use a locally hosted version of this app to collaboratively discuss and analyze many iterations of their experiments in ways that were previously impossible. While images from this app were not used directly in publications, its usage catalyzed the visualizations that were necessary for publishing novel CFMH research.<br><br>
        I made a point to highlight the future possibility of developing a more full featured application centered around Three.js, and encouraged David and his peers to be aware of other neuroscience research efforts that might leverage Three. This led to CFMH becoming some of the first users of BrainBrowser, a Three.js based tool developed by computational neuroscientists at McGill. By giving CFMH researchers the framework to think beyond Freesurfer, David and I revolutionized how fMRI research findings were communicated at the Center.<br><br>

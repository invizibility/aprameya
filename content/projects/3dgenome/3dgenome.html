    <h4>Description</h4>

<p>This project was one of my main efforts during the Summer 2016 Data Visualization Internship at the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab + Caltech. In collaboration with fellow intern <a href="http://petepolack.com/">Peter Polack</a>,  I worked with the <a href="http://guttmanlab.caltech.edu">Guttman Lab for lncRNA biology</a> to devise a workflow for exploring complex datasets describing the 3 dimensional conformation of genomic data inside cells, so as to identify potentially interesting patterns. The recent increased availability of such structural datasets has many genomicists interested in studying relationships between genomic structure and function. During our 10 week program, Peter and I designed a coherent visual schema for representing and exploring structural genomic data in 3D and 2D, and created an interactive web-based prototype for scientists to visualize and explore structures using our paradigm.</p>

<h4>Process</h4>

<p>Currently, there are no standard tools used to visualize 3 dimensional genomic structures with functional annotations, so researchers in this novel data space resort to piecing together workflows with individual non-integrated software packages that visualize either structural data or functional data in 2D. Peter and I extensively interviewed different Guttman Lab researchers to identify roadblocks in their current data exploration workflows and created a conceptual model for a structure-function interface that would provide an integrated and intuitive experience for exploring interesting patterns in 3D structural genomic data. We also used these interview opportunities to explore various types of visual media our researcher collaborators found effective for describing and making obvious particular structural characteristics involved in their hypothesis testing processes. These discussions allowed us to develop novel interaction designs for our visualization that were absent in current toolsets, but intuitive to our researchers and consistent with the visual grammar they employ.</p>

<p>We used an iterative prototyping process leveraging both interactive prototypes and paper prototypes. The range of design materials Peter and I utilized in with the Guttman Lab researchers included paper storyboards, whiteboard sessions, 2d vector illustrated storyboards, and interactive javascript visualizations. Learning to move seamlessly between paper prototype materials and interactive digital prototypes as we progressed through the conceptual development of our data visualization solution was a central learning experience for me in this project.</p>

<p>I am currently extending this work as part of my thesis research at Carnegie Mellon centered around designing data visualizations for genomics.

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>
    While a student at UW Madison, I developed an extensive working relationship with the <a href="https://eliceirilab.org/">Laboratory for Optical and Computational Imagery (LOCI)</a>, led by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W86WgnQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Kevin Eliceiri</a>. LOCI conducts applied optics research involving the engineering of novel microscopy techniques for the purpose of furthering cell biology research. My work with LOCI spanned a variety of projects anchored around the central theme of creating tools for explainability and interpretability of the high dimensional microscopy datasets generated by bleeding edge optical methods utilized at the Lab<br><br>
    One of my major contributions was a series of animated Flash videos describing a variety of optical concepts implemented in the multispectral microscopes developed at the Lab. These initially were designed for training new grad students and technicians on equipment; eventually many senior members of the Lab sought to use these videos for broader teaching purposes.<br><br>

    <h3>Process:</h3>
    <p>
        Kevin had a need for concise visual explanations of several microscopy techniques that were staple ingredients of the Lab’s work. Additionally, Kevin was interested in the idea of a series of related animations that would articulate the similarities and differences between fundamental optical microscopy methods and the more novel complex methods developed at the Lab.

    <h4>User Research</h4>
    <p>
        In order to create the right visual language for this use case, it was important to validate representations of the important concepts with both microscopy experts and novices. I interviewed a variety of stakeholders, ranging from senior researchers such as Kevin and <a href="https://campagnola.engr.wisc.edu/">Paul Campagnola</a>, to members of the target audience, which included a selection of graduate students and other junior members of the Lab.

    <h4>Iterating & Delivering the Product</h4>
    <p>
        I performed a balancing act in the iteration phase between creating visual language that met the rigorous technical specificity expected by the senior researchers while being accessible and useful to more junior members of the lab. Working with scientists such as Paul, who is considered a pioneer in the field of microscopy for his innovations around the optical methods I was describing, set the bar high for scientific clarity in these animations.<br><br>
        My final delivery was a series of animations and a visual style guide for extending these animations into future iterations. Starting with simple confocal microscopy, the series progresses through multiphoton microscopy and finally showcases variations of Second Harmonic Generation microscopy techniques.<br><br>

    </p>
    <h3>Impact:</h3>
    <p>
        These animations have been widely used by Kevin, Paul and others to succinctly explain the physics that underpin the innovations at the Lab. The series has been included in teaching materials at UW and become a highly viewed part of LOCI’s educational youtube channel.<br><br>
        The style guide has been used to develop updated 3D versions of the original animations, using the original visual language but with more advanced animation techniques. </p>

        <p>When this project was started, Kevin remarked to me that no such visual explanations had existed as an easily accessible entry point into complex optical microscopy. It is gratifying and humbling to have delivered a product that amplifies the amazing work done at LOCI to a broader audience, and to help curious minds learn about microscopy.<br><br>

    <h4>Background:</h4>

<p>At NASA JPL, spacecraft mission Ground Data Systems (GDS's) retain and use tons of sensitive ITAR data, which makes them attractive targets for state sponsored hackers. Over the past several years, these hacks have become increasingly problematic for JPL, leading to a NASA executive mandate that each mission be responsible for developing cyber situational awareness tools to prevent these incidents.

    At the time of CyberSAMâ€™s conception, no software solution existed for GDS sysadmins to easily monitor the cybersecurity posture of their mission networks. These sysadmins preside over environments with up to several thousands of machines, so achieving situational awareness out of the raw logs from all these machines without a robust analytics platform is a borderline impossible task.
    
    My team and I created CyberSAM as a turnkey solution for GDS sysadmins desperately in need of observability into complex mission networks. Our objective with the CyberSAM tool suite was to provide a collection of advanced anomaly detection algorithms to parse and interpret the firehose of mission environment log data, coupled with an elegant UI to deliver actionable intelligence to mission sysadmins. 
    
    Here's an animated short I created demonstrating the value proposition of the early CyberSAM releases:

</p>



<h4>Process</h4>

<p>My primary role on the CyberSAM team was to create and drive a roadmap for design and development of the UI/UX of this tool suite. This involved extensive user research with mission clients, architecting a product lifecycle for the UI over a 3 year period, and pushing the boundaries of UI implementation inside Splunk Enterprise to the point of setting new industry standards for dashboard development.</p>

<h5>Initial User Research</h5>

<p>I began work on CyberSAM by architecting a user research strategy to interview stakeholders, identify pain points, scope the user base and use cases, and sketch out possible interaction designs. I distilled my UX research findings into a series of artifacts used to communicate a product roadmap to project leadership and initiate the development process.</p>

<p>We used an iterative prototyping process leveraging both interactive prototypes and paper prototypes. The range of design materials Peter and I utilized in with the Guttman Lab researchers included paper storyboards, whiteboard sessions, 2d vector illustrated storyboards, and interactive javascript visualizations. Learning to move seamlessly between paper prototype materials and interactive digital prototypes as we progressed through the conceptual development of our data visualization solution was a central learning experience for me in this project.</p>

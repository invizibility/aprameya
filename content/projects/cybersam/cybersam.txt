Background:

At NASA JPL, spacecraft mission Ground Data Systems (GDS's) retain and use tons of sensitive ITAR data, which makes them attractive targets
for state sponsored hackers. Over the past several years, these hacks have become increasingly problematic for JPL, leading to a NASA mandate that each mission be responsible for developing cyber situational awareness tools to prevent these incidents.

Compounding the severity of this cybersecurity issue, the sysadmins who preside over these GDS systems were given full responsibility of implementing this mandate, without any mission specific cybersecurity tools to assist their efforts. GDS sysadmins preside over
environments with up to several thousands of machines, so creating situational awareness out of the raw logs from all these machines can be a borderline impossible task.

We created CyberSAM as a generalizable solution to this issue. Our objective with the CyberSAM tool suite was to provide a collection of advanced anomaly detection algorithms to parse and interpret the firehose of mission environment log data, coupled with an elegant UI
to deliver actionable intelligence to mission sysadmins.

Here's an animated short I created demonstrating the value proposition of the early CyberSAM releases:

Process:

Initial User Research:

The first stage of this project was to architect a user research strategy to identify pain points, scope the user base and use cases, and sketch out possible interactions.
I created a variety of artifacts to distill my findings from many interviews I conducted with a variety of stakeholders.

This initial pass of UX research fueled the first implementation of CyberSAM, which was built as a series of dashboards in a Splunk Enterprise Application. The first iteration app was a great success and brought in 6 JPL missions as clients.
However, the increase in popularity of our application led to many feature requests which exposed glaring weaknesses in the scalability of a dashboard-based application as a situational awareness solution. Fortunately our overwhelming success with the 
first iteration of the app created organizational buy-in allowing us to expand the UI/UX team from just myself to a team of 5 engineers and designers, whom I led to bring about the second and third major releases of our app.

Developing the Product:

Issues with V1:

Scaling our product to support many more use cases and clients forced us to significantly re-evaluate the design and implementation of our entire application on several fronts.
On the front end, I led the UI/UX team in a second round of research to identify specific pain points with the dashboard-based paradigm. 
This led to many revelations about the nature of limitations we were hitting with our dashboard-based app, ranging from 

- information dilution
- branching factor
-- inverse correlation between feature development and usability

On the more technical side of the front end, I led another effort to address the implementation specific issues that prevented us from achieving op

- contrived component development
-- inverse correlation between product scale and DX

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>This project was a collaboration with <a href="http://aman.work">Aman Tiwari</a> in Dana Cupkova’s <a href="https://danacupkova.com/portfolio/ecologics/">Ecologics</a> class. During the class we explored themes of parametric design and biomimicry, and we created this viewing apparatus as a culmination of our semester efforts. </p>
    <p>We were interested in the local cultural dynamics of the Pittsburgh technology/startup scene, and wanted to explore how use of data visualization and biological metaphor can create dialogue and reflection about the relationship between our tech community and the larger social ecology of Pittsburgh. We were also very inspired by <a href="http://www.terreform.org/projects_urbanity_bio_city_map.html">Terreform One’s Bio City Map of 11 Billion</a> and wanted to create an artifact that was not only a data visualization but a data driven organic ecosystem that locally simulates human social processes with bacterial + fungal life forms.</p>

    <p>The result of our exploration was a physical map interface which combines robotic and organic components to present data about cultural change in Pittsburgh as a simulated fungal ecosystem. Viewers can observe data about tech investment, gentrification, and racial consolidation projection mapped across a transluscent agar topography of Pittsburgh, which also is host to slime mold spores located at technological epicenters in Pittsburgh.</p>
    <p> A robotic feeding system is fitted atop the topography and programatically feeds the spores through a servo actuated syringe which dispenses Soylent in one of two feeding patterns: either replaying historic data on tech investment in Pittsburgh or accepting interactive input from viewers. We invite viewers to compare the patterns of mold growth, tech investment, and gentrification superimposed upon one another in this map, and to think about how an influx of capital investment in “tech culture” can transform a local human ecosystem in both positive and negative ways.</p>
    <h3>Process:</h3>
    <p>Our process on this project involved the design and fabrication of both software infrastructure and physical infrastructure. We worked in parallel curating data for visualization, designing a projection system to display this data, and fabricating the physical media which would host our aggregate system.</p>
    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>The first task we tackled was the collection of data to visualize. We met with members of tech incubators, CMU faculty involved with startup spinoffs, leaders of Pittsburgh technology trade organizations, and community activists to get a sense of which datasets we could put together to showcase a recent history of technology investment, gentrification, and socio-economic change in Pittsburgh. We ended up with an exhaustive list of tech companies in Pittsburgh, identifying their location and date they began to physically operate in Pittsburgh, as well as census block-resolution data about race, educational attainment, and income over the past 20 years. We iterated through both data sources and visualization methods when exploring how to map this data.</p>

    <p>As we curated the necessary data and explored visualization strategies, we experimented with the visual mapping possiblities of mold growth, and observed how mold growth patterns change as a function of type and distribution of available nutrition. The mold species we used, Physarum Polycephalum, carries a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/01/slime-mold-grows-network-just-like-tokyo-rail-system/">rich</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02441">precedent</a> of being used to visualize topological optimization problems. Our desire to use Physarum to simulate the growth of tech industry in a local ecology fits perfectly within this paradigm. By experimenting with different mold growth conditions, we gained understanding how to integrate the mold into the overall composition of our map interface.</p>

    <h4>Assembly</h4>
    <p>We then transmuted our visualization into a physical form by CNC milling and vacuum forming a topography of Pittsburgh, and creating an agar cast across this topography. I have created an <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-an-Agar-Topography/">Instructable</a> explaining our pipeline for creating a physical agar cast topography from a shapefile and digital topography imagery.</p>

    <p>Physarum Polycephalum slime mold spores were then placed at the epicenters of tech growth. Once the topography was complete and seeded, we assembled an acrylic + 80/20 aluminum frame as a viewing platform for the map and fitted the robotic feeding system above the map. To dispense the Soylent feeding solution, we designed and 3D-printed a mount to actuate a syringe with the servo motor built into the plotter head of the MakeBlock X-Y plotter.</p>

    <p>Finally we connected the backend of our Javascript visualization to a node server controlling the plotter, which completed the interactive loop of the interface. Using the data coordinates showing tech businesses emerge over our 20 year timespan of interest, we fed the map to achieve an ‘initial state’ for interactivity. We then observed how the initial state patterns juxtaposed against projection mapping of race and gentrification data onto the agar substrate.</p>

    <h3>Impact:</h3>
    <p>This project allowed us to showcase an entirely novel method of data visualization by unifying physical sculpture, guided organic systems, and light projection of digital data visualization into a single cybernetic assemblage. With this precedent, we hope to further develop this visualization modality in future collaborative projects.</p>
    <p>The Instructable I made to describe the process of creating an agar topology has reached a wide audience, inspiring others to make agar maps for all kinds of different artistic objectives.</p>
    <p>Soylent Saviour was also selected for presentation at <a href="http://acadia.org/">ACADIA 2016</a>, as part of the <a href="http://acadia.org/projects/4979CR">Contingent Landscapes</a> project.<br><br></p>
